<p>While they hoped they would find a pot of <b>gold</b>, neither of them truly believed that the mythical pot would actually be there. </p>

Nor did they believe they could actually find the end of the rainbow. Still, it seemed like a fun activity for the day, and pictures of them chasing rainbows would look great on their Instagram accounts. They would have never believed they would actually find the end of a rainbow, and when they did, what they actually found there.
