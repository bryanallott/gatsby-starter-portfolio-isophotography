Many years ago, the term wildlife did not exist, because there was no need for it. Everything was wild, so classifying it would be too obvious.

These days, that is not the case, which leads us to go against a currnt social trend. In everyday life, everything changes consantly, to the extent that the 'hangers-on' are ridiculed. When it comes to wildlife, we do the opposite. In a world in which many species have been domesticated, we celebrate the ones that still hang on. We celebrate the wild.
