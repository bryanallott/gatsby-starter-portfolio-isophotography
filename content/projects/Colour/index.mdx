Abstract, the mind of the eye. 

You have heard of the mind's eye, which sees something real while it currently does not exist for the eyes to see. Abstract is the mind of the eye, which sees something that currently exists and looks closer, imagining things within it that do not exist.

The beauty of this is that you get to see the world from a completely diiferent perspective.
